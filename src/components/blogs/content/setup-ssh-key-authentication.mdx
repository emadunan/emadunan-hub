# SSH key authentication offers a secure and convenient way to connect to remote Linux servers without typing your password every time. In this guide, you'll learn how to generate an SSH key pair, add the public key to a server, and disable password-based authentication for improved security.

## 1. Check for Existing SSH Keys

First, open your terminal and run:

```bash
ls ~/.ssh/id_*
```

If you already see files like `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`, you can skip to [Step 3](#3-copy-your-public-key-to-the-server).

## 2. Generate a New SSH Key Pair

To create a new SSH key pair using the default algorithm (Ed25519):

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

You’ll be prompted to:

- Enter a file path (press **Enter** to accept default `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`)
- Set a passphrase (optional, for extra security)

Example output:

```
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

## 3. Copy Your Public Key to the Server

If your server is reachable via SSH (e.g., `root@your-server-ip`), copy your public key with:

```bash
ssh-copy-id root@your-server-ip
```

You’ll be prompted to enter the remote user's password once.

Alternatively, manually copy the contents of `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` and paste it into the server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

## 4. Test SSH Key Authentication

Try logging in again:

```bash
ssh root@your-server-ip
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should connect without entering a password.

## 5. (Optional) Disable Password Authentication

Once you're confident that key-based login works, you can disable password authentication for added security:

### Edit the SSH daemon config on the server:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Update or ensure the following lines:

```
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
```

Then restart the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

> ⚠️ Make sure your key authentication is working before disabling password login, or you could lock yourself out.

You're now using secure, key-based SSH authentication. This method reduces the risk of brute-force attacks and improves automation workflows.
