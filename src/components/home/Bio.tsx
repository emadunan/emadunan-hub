      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m <strong>Emad Younan</strong>, a full-stack web developer from Egypt
        with over 7 years of hands-on experience in JavaScript, TypeScript,
        React, Next.js, NestJS, and PostgreSQL. I build elegant, performant, and
        scalable applications for the modern web.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey has been shaped by deep faith, national pride, and
        resilience. As a Christian in Egypt, I’ve encountered unique challenges,
        but I’ve always chosen to respond with strength, compassion, and a
        commitment to excellence. I love my country and believe in making a
        positive difference—guided by the teachings of Jesus to overcome
        adversity with grace and perseverance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I served as an officer in the Egyptian Police after graduating with a
        degree in Information Systems. During my decade of service, I
        specialized in technical infrastructure and systems administration. In
        2017, I transitioned to web development, pouring years of intense study
        into becoming a certified, skilled, and passionate developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve earned multiple credentials from institutions like Harvard and
        Udacity, and I now dedicate myself to solving problems with code,
        delivering real-world value, and continuing my personal and professional
        transformation. Along the way, I’ve also excelled in physical and
        tactical challenges—achieving top ranks in police-level shooting
        competitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the discipline and intensity of my journey, I’m a deeply
        sensitive, romantic soul. I’m currently single and open to new chapters
        in both life and love.
